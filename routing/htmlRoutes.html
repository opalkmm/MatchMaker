*A GET Route to /survey which should display the survey page.
A default, catch-all route that leads to home.html which displays the home page.
Your apiRoutes.js file should contain two routes:

A GET route with the url /api/friends. This will be used to display a JSON of all possible friends.
A POST routes /api/friends. This will be used to handle incoming survey results. This route will also be used to handle the compatibility logic.
You should save your application's data inside of app/data/friends.js as an array of objects.*
